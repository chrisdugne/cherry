Cherry is the `CoronaSDK App` starter for [Uralys](http://uralys.com/games) mobile games provided as a ready-to go Corona Application.

You may use Cherry as a base to start your own game, with the following facilities:

#### Game worflow

Avoid developing your screens by using many pre-defined screens to go straight to the point :

- Home + Options
- Level Selection
- Playground
- Score
- Profiles
- Credits

#### Libraries

Many libraries to provide easy tooling for your app :

- screen **routing**
- game **Camera**
- **touch** controller
- **sound** library (music + effects)
- a sublevel to register **effects** from [CBEffects](https://github.com/GymbylCoding/CBEffects).
- **user** profile and game status
- google **analytics** events (a lot are already plugged in the workflow)

#### Components

Either use these components within the full workflow or pick them one by one to use it in your own game :

- Focus
- Progress Bar
- Scroller
